FEATURES                                  *puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--features*

- When typing `{}` in a **Python string** automatically converts it to an f-string.
- Adding `${}` or a line break in a **JavaScript string** automatically converts it to a template string. (Also works in related languages like JS-React or Typescript.)
- Typing `%s` in a **non-pattern Lua string** automatically converts it to a formatted string. (Opt-in, as this has |puppeteer-some-caveats|.)
- _Removing_ the `{}`, `${}`, or `%s` converts it back to a regular string.
- Also works with multi-line strings and undos.
- Zero configuration. Just install and you are ready to go.


REQUIREMENTS                          *puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--requirements*

- nvim 0.9 or higher.
- The respective Treesitter parsers: `:TSInstall python javascript typescript`. (Installing them requires nvim-treesitter <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter>.)


INSTALLATION                          *puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--installation*

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    { 
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer",
        lazy = false, -- plugin lazy-loads itself. Can also load on filetypes.
    },
    
    -- packer
    use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer" }
<

There is no `.setup()` call. The plugin already automatically loads as little
as possible.


SPECIAL CASE: FORMATTED STRINGS IN LUA*puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--special-case:-formatted-strings-in-lua*

Through string.format
<https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#pdf-string.format>, there are also
formatted strings in Lua. However, auto-conversions are far more difficult in
lua `%s` is used as a placeholder for `string.format` and as class in lua
patterns <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.1> at the same time.
While it is possible to identify in some cases whether a lua string is used as
pattern, there are certain cases where that is not possible:

>lua
    -- desired: conversion to format string when typing the placeholder "%s"
    local str = "foobar %s baz" -- before
    local str = ("foobar %s baz"):format() -- after
    
    -- problem case that can be dealt with: "%s" used as class in lua pattern
    local found = str:find("foobar %s")
    
    -- problem case that cannot be dealt with: "%s" in string, which
    -- is only later used as pattern
    local pattern = "foobar %s baz"
    -- some code…
    str:find(pattern)
<

Since the auto-conversion of lua strings can result in undesired false
conversions, the feature is opt-in only. This way, you can decide for yourself
whether the occasional false positive is worth it for you or not.

>lua
    -- enable auto-conversion of lua strings (default: false)
    vim.g.puppeteer_lua_format_string = true
<


  [!NOTE] After enabling, you can also set the variable to `false` temporarily to
  pause the auto-conversion. This can be useful if only one specific string gives
  you trouble.

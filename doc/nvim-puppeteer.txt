strings and back.

FEATURES                             *nvim-puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--features*

- When typing `{}` in a **Python string** automatically converts it to a
    f-string.
- Adding `${}` or a line break in a **JavaScript string** automatically converts
    it to a template string. (Also works in related languages like JS-React or
    TypeScript.)
- Typing `%s` in a **non-pattern Lua string** automatically converts it to a
    formatted string. (Opt-in, as this has |nvim-puppeteer-some-caveats|.)
- _Removing_ the `{}`, `${}`, or `%s` converts it back to a regular string.
- Also works with multiline strings and undos.
- Zero configuration. Just install and you are ready to go.


REQUIREMENTS                     *nvim-puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--requirements*

- nvim 0.9 or higher.
- The respective Treesitter parsers: `:TSInstall python javascript typescript`.
    (Installing them requires
    nvim-treesitter <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter>.)


INSTALLATION                     *nvim-puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--installation*

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    { 
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer",
        lazy = false, -- plugin lazy-loads itself. Can also load on filetypes.
    },
    
    -- packer
    use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer" }
<

There is no `.setup()` call. The plugin already automatically lazy-loads itself
(and is lightweight to begin with).

You can disable `nvim-puppeteer` only for specific filetypes via:


CONFIGURATION                   *nvim-puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--configuration*

Shown are the default values.

>lua
    -- list of filestypes (please see the README before enabling this plugin for lua)
    vim.g.puppeteer_disable_filetypes = { "lua" }
    
    -- quotation mark to use when converting back to normal string (" or ')
    vim.g.puppeteer_js_quotation_mark = '"'
<


  [!NOTE] When using `lazy.nvim`, `vim.g.…` variables must be set in `init`,
  not in `config`.

USER COMMANDS                   *nvim-puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--user-commands*

The plugin is enabled by default and lazy-loaded upon opening a relevant
filetype. In case you wish to turn of puppeteer for the current buffer, the
following user commands are provided:

- `PuppeteerToggle`: Toggle puppeteer for the current buffer.
- `PuppeteerDisable`: Disable puppeteer for the current buffer.
- `PuppeteerEnable`: Enable puppeteer for the current buffer.


SPECIAL CASE: FORMATTED STRINGS IN LUA*nvim-puppeteer-nvim-puppeteer--special-case:-formatted-strings-in-lua*

Through string.format
<https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#pdf-string.format>, there are also
formatted strings in Lua. However, auto-conversions are far more difficult in
Lua `%s` is used as a placeholder for `string.format` and as class in lua
patterns <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.1> at the same time.
While it is possible to identify in some cases whether a Lua string is used as
pattern, there are certain cases where that is not possible:

>lua
    -- desired: conversion to format string when typing the placeholder "%s"
    local str = "foobar %s baz" -- before
    local str = ("foobar %s baz"):format() -- after
    
    -- problem case that can be dealt with: "%s" used as class in lua pattern
    local found = str:find("foobar %s")
    
    -- problem case that cannot be dealt with: "%s" in string, which
    -- is only later used as pattern
    local pattern = "foobar %s baz"
    -- some code…
    str:find(pattern)
<

Since the auto-conversion of Lua strings can result in undesired false
conversions, the feature is opt-in only. This way, you can decide for yourself
whether the occasional false positive is worth it for you or not.

>lua
    -- Enable auto-conversion of lua strings by removing lua from the disabled filetypes
    vim.g.puppeteer_disable_filetypes = {}
<


  [!TIP] You can also use `PuppeteerToggle` to temporarily disable the plugin for
  the current buffer, if a specific Lua string is giving you trouble.

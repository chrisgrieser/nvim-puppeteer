## Features
- When typing `{}` in a **Python string** automatically converts it to an f-string.
- Adding `${}` or a line break in a **JavaScript string** automatically converts
  it to a template string. (Also works in related languages like JS-React or
  Typescript.)
- Typing `%s` in a **non-pattern Lua string** automatically converts it to a
  formatted string. (Opt-in, as this has [some
  caveats](#special-case-formatted-strings-in-lua).)
- *Removing* the `{}`, `${}`, or `%s` converts it back to a regular string.
- Also works with multi-line strings and undos.
- Zero configuration. Just install and you are ready to go.

## Requirements
- nvim 0.9 or higher.
- The respective Treesitter parsers: `:TSInstall python javascript typescript`.
  (Installing them requires
  [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).)

## Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{ 
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer",
	lazy = false, -- plugin lazy-loads itself. Can also load on filetypes.
},

-- packer
use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer" }
```

There is no `.setup()` call. The plugin already automatically lazy-loads itself
(and is lightweight to begin with).

You can disable `nvim-puppeteer` only for specific filetypes via:

## Configuration
Shown are the default values.

```lua
-- list of filestypes (please see the README before enabling this plugin for lua)
vim.g.puppeteer_disable_filetypes = { "lua" }

-- quotation mark to use when converting back to normal string (" or ')
vim.g.puppeteer_js_quotation_mark = '"'
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using `lazy.nvim`, `vim.g.â€¦` variables must be set in `init`, not in
> `config`.

## User commands
The plugin is enabled by default and lazy-loaded upon opening a relevant file type.
In case you wish to turn of puppeteer for the current buffer, the following user
commands are provided:

- `PuppeteerToggle`: Toggle puppeteer for the current buffer.
- `PuppeteerDisable`: Disable puppeteer for the current buffer.
- `PuppeteerEnable`: Enable puppeteer for the current buffer.

## Special case: formatted strings in Lua
Through
[string.format](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#pdf-string.format),
there are also formatted strings in Lua. However, auto-conversions are far more
difficult in lua `%s` is used as a placeholder for `string.format` and [as class
in lua patterns](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.1) at the same
time. While it is possible to identify in some cases whether a lua string is
used as pattern, there are certain cases where that is not possible:

```lua
-- desired: conversion to format string when typing the placeholder "%s"
local str = "foobar %s baz" -- before
local str = ("foobar %s baz"):format() -- after

-- problem case that can be dealt with: "%s" used as class in lua pattern
local found = str:find("foobar %s")

-- problem case that cannot be dealt with: "%s" in string, which
-- is only later used as pattern
local pattern = "foobar %s baz"
-- some codeâ€¦
str:find(pattern)
```

Since the auto-conversion of lua strings can result in undesired false
conversions, the feature is opt-in only. This way, you can decide for yourself
whether the occasional false positive is worth it for you or not.

```lua
-- Enable auto-conversion of lua strings by removing lua from the disabled filetypes
vim.g.puppeteer_disable_filetypes = {}
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also use `PuppeteerToggle` to temporarily disable the plugin for the
> current buffer, if a specific lua string is giving you trouble.
